001 Therefore, you are unapologetic, o human, each one judging,
    for in that which you judge another, you judge yourself,
    for you ones judging practice the same things.
002 But we see that the judgment of God is according to truth upon those practicing such things.
003 But do you logize this, o human,
    judging those practicing such things
    and doing the same things,
    that you will flee the judgment of God?
004 Or do you downsense the muchness of His kindness and His holdup and His large temperament,
    not knowing that the kind things of God brings you to repentance?
005 But, according to your hardness and unrepentant heart,
    you are depositing anger in the day of anger for yourself
    and uncoverage of the righteous judgment of God?
