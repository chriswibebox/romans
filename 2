001 Therefore, you are unapologetic, o human, each one judging,
    for in that which you judge another, you judge yourself,
    for you ones judging practice the same things.
002 But we see that the judgment of God is according to truth upon those practicing such things.
003 But do you logize this, o human,
    judging those practicing such things
    and doing the same things,
    that you will flee the judgment of God?
